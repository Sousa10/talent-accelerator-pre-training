# SQL: SELECT statements

The objective of this exercise is to train the mind to visualize how data is structured and how it is related within a relational database.

Do the following:
1. Download the SQL client [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)
2. Install it and when it asks you if you want to create a sample database, answer "Yes". DBeaver will create a SQLite database with a few tables.
3. Write SQL statements that display the data requested in the statements of the following tables. To open a SQL script editor, `right click on the database --> SQL Editor --> New SQl Script`.
4. Record a video showing your _queries_ and explaining what each SQL word or clause you needed to use is for.
