# Object-oriented programming

The objective of this exercise is to learn and put into practice the main concepts of object-oriented programming.

For each of the following concepts:

- What is an object? What parts does it consist of?
- Message passing
- Encapsulation
- Composition
- What is a class? How is an object created from a class?
- What is inheritance between classes?
- Overriding (of functions/methods and properties/fields/attributes)
- Abstract functions and abstract fields.

Do the following:

- Look up information about it.
- Try to understand it, so you can explain it to someone else who knows nothing about it.
- Choose a programming language and put it into practice with a small example.
- Record a video showing your code and explaining how you have applied the concept.
